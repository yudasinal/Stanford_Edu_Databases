Q1
It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler. 

delete
from Highschooler 
where grade = 12

Q2
If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple. 

delete from Likes 
where iD1 in
(select iD1 from Friend) 
and iD2 in
(select iD2 from Friend where iD1 = Likes.iD1)
and iD2 not in 
(select iD1 from Likes L1 where L1.iD2 = Likes.iD1)


Q3
For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. (This one is a bit challenging; congratulations if you get it right.) 

insert into Friend 
select F1.iD1, F2.iD2 from Friend F1, Friend F2
where F1.iD2 = F2.iD1
and F1.iD1 <> F2.iD2
except 
select * from Friend
