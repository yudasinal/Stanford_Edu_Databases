avg(doc("countries.xml")//country[language="Russian"]/data(@population))

Q4
Return the names of all countries where over 50% of the population speaks German. (Hint: Depending on your solution, you may want to use ".", which refers to the "current element" within an XPath expression.) 

let $c := doc('countries.xml')/countries
return $c//language[data(.) = 'German' and @percentage > 50]/parent::country/data(@name)

Q5
