Q1
Write a trigger that makes new students named 'Friendly' automatically like everyone else in their grade. That is, after the trigger runs, we should have ('Friendly', A) in the Likes table for every other Highschooler A in the same grade as 'Friendly'.

Create trigger fr
after insert on Highschooler
for each row when (new.name = 'Friendly')
begin insert into Likes select new.id, id from Highschooler where grade = new.grade 
and id <> new.id;
end


Q2
Write one or more triggers to manage the grade attribute of new Highschoolers. If the inserted tuple has a value less than 9 or greater than 12, change the value to NULL. On the other hand, if the inserted tuple has a null value for grade, change it to 9. 

create trigger cg
after insert on Highschooler
for each row when (new.grade < 9 or new.grade > 12)
begin update Highschooler set grade=null where id=new.id; end;
|
create trigger cg1
after insert on Highschooler
for each row when (new.grade is null)
begin update Highschooler set grade=9 where id=new.id;
end;

Q3
Write a trigger that automatically deletes students when they graduate, i.e., when their grade is updated to exceed 12. 

create trigger d
after update of grade on Highschooler 
for each row when new.grade>12
begin delete from Highschooler where id = new.id; 
end;
